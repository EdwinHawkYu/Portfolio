        <p>
          I am a full stack-developer with a Mechanical Engineering education.
          I have over two years of experience working in the manufacturing Aerospace and Defense Industry.
          I am highly passionate about working on challenging projects in the tech industry and thrive in learning environments. I am a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersion program
          and have created multiple applications during my time in the 3 month program.
          
          <br/><br/>
          My past experience working on continous improvement projects has uplifted the web applications created during my coding bootcamp and I see quality improvements made to them and future projects.
          I hope to join a team of highly motivated individuals that is willing to take me alongside their development journey and I will show my value added to the team!
